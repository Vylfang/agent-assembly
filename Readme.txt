Agent Assembly Game

Based on Contact Cowboy by Jrap (at : https://jrap.itch.io/contact-cowboy)
Using (badly) Lazy Foo' SDL Tutorials (at : http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)
Font "gymkhana-bf.ttf" was made by Raymond Larabie (at : http://typodermicfonts.com)


Known Bug :
 - Sprites disappear if reducing game window.



To do list :

 - make clean code
 - add comment
 - add menu
 - add keybinding options
 - bind options (keybinding, number of neutrals, turn time, character speed etc...) to a text file
 - make it more than 2 player & use player class efficiently.
 - add invisibility as a special move

For Fun list :
 - add more special move (smoke bomb, fake death)
 - try to meddle in resolution options
 - try multithreading and add a console options
 - make it online multiplayer
