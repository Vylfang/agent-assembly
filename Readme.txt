Agent Assembly Game

Based on Contact Cowboy by Jrap (at : https://jrap.itch.io/contact-cowboy)
Using (badly) Lazy Foo' SDL Tutorials (at : http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)
Font "joystix monospace.ttf" was made by Raymond Larabie (at : http://typodermicfonts.com)


Known Bug :
 - Sprites disappear if reducing game window.

To do list :

 - make clean code (make widgets as class)
 - add comments
 - make it more than 2 player & use player class efficiently. (player[i] instead of a/b)
 - add invisibility as a special move

For Fun list :
 - add more special move (smoke bomb, fake death, jazz hands)
 - try to meddle in resolution options
 - try multithreading and add a console options
 - make it online multiplayer
